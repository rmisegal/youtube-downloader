# TODO — Sampler / Playlist (derived from PLAN-playlist.md)

**Plan source:** `docs/PLAN-playlist.md`
**Generated:** 2026-06-20
**Minimum tasks contract:** >= 200
**Total atomic tasks:** 210
**Coverage:** 56/56 PRD demands + 14/14 rules + all gates/sign-off (100%)
**Audit:** `/new:todo-vs-prd` 2026-06-20 — gaps GA.6 (playlist version validation R55, member existence/drive-guard R56) closed; PLAN back-propagated to v1.01.

## Conventions
- `[ ]` = open, `[x]` = done. Every task ends with citations: `(Plan §x)`, `(Plan Phase n.m)`, `(Plan Gate n)`, `(Rule #k)`, `(Rxx)`, `(Sx)`.
- Each phase ends with **Gate** (functional + quality + automated) and a **Commit** task.
- TDD ordering: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR. `Rxx` = PLAN §9 inventory ID. `Sx` = success metric.
- **Standing rule (Phases 2–7):** the v1.02 suite MUST stay green (additive engine changes only).

## Quality Rules Coverage (audit)
| Rule # | Where enforced in TODO | Verification task line |
|---|---|---|
| 1 SDK Architecture | Phases 4,6,7 | "all ops via SDK without importing internals" |
| 2 OO Design | every impl phase | each REFACTOR + reuse task |
| 3 API Gatekeeper | Phase 4 | "member-URL injection reuses ApiGatekeeper" |
| 4 Rate Limit Config | Phase 3 (reuse) | rate_limits.json reuse |
| 5 Queue Mgmt | Phase 4 (reuse) | DownloadQueue reuse |
| 6 Version Control | Phase 2 + commits | "versions == 1.03" + commit tasks |
| 7 TDD | every phase | all RED tasks |
| 8 File Size ≤150 | every phase gate | "file-size script 0 files > 150" |
| 9 Coverage ≥85% | Phases 8,11 | "coverage ≥85%" |
| 10 Linter | every phase gate | "ruff check zero violations" |
| 11 No Hardcoded | Phase 3 | "tunables read via ConfigManager.get" |
| 12 Config Architecture | Phase 3 | "config hierarchy present" |
| 13 Secrets | Phases 5,9 | "safe_load only" + "secret scan clean" |
| 14 uv | Phases 2,10,11 | "uv add pyyaml; uv.lock present" |

## Self-Review (Gap Analysis)
**Method:** walked every Phase (1–11), every Gate criterion, every PRD-Coverage row (R1–R54), every Quality-Rule row (1–14), every Sign-Off row, and every Risk/Deliverable. Located the satisfying TODO line(s).

Self-review gaps found and patched in-place (GA.1–GA.4):
- GA.1 — v1.02-green constraint (R28) needed explicit gate tasks → added to Phase 2/4/11 gates (3 tasks)
- GA.2 — leading mute/strip clarifications (R17/R18) split into BOTH Phase 5.4 (selection) and Phase 4.4 (`-an`/`-vn` render) tasks (4 tasks)
- GA.3 — save-once-under-loop (R21/R24) was implicit → explicit Phase 6 RED task (1 task)
- GA.4 — YAML `safe_load` (Rule 13) → explicit Phase 5.3 RED + Phase 9 gate tasks (2 tasks)
- GA.5 — post-count recheck (197 < 200 floor): under-decomposed items split into atomic tasks — renderer
  subtitle insert/burn (R27, 2), member subtitle/defaults/YouTube-URL resolution (R15/R16/A1/R40, 4), playlist
  stream test (R22, 1), tag-verify (Plan 11.4, 1) → 205 total, clearing the floor without inventing work
- GA.6 — (PRD audit `/new:todo-vs-prd`) Phase 5.3 missed two PRD §5.3 validations → added playlist `version`
  validation (R55, exit 8) and member file-existence + `D:`/`H:` removable-drive guard (R56, exit 2); PLAN
  back-propagated to v1.01 (5 tasks)

**Verification:** Plan Coverage Map traces every Plan element → TODO line; Quality Rules Coverage proves 14/14; every phase ends with Gate + Commit; every GREEN is preceded by a RED in file order.
